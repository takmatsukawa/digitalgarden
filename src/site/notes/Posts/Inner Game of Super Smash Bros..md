Last year, after learning how to learn on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/), I was looking for a next step. I found that Bill Gates mentioned a book called *Inner Game of Tennis*, so I borrowed the book from the library. Surprisingly, my English teacher knew the book, so it probably is still quite famous in the US.

This is engaging and applicable book to my own life. I don't play tennis; hoping I will though, but this book will help my mental and physical approach to the performance in any activities.

The author gives a lot of interesting perspectives. This book worth to read providing that I apply it to my life. Let's think about that. Recently, I'm really into the Super Smash Bros, popupar fighting console game. What will happen if I focus into my inner game of Super Smash Bros.?
