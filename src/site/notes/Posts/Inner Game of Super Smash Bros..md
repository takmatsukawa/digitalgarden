Last year, after learning how to learn on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/), I was looking for a next step. I found that Bill Gates mentioned a book called *Inner Game of Tennis*, so I borrowed the book from the library. Surprisingly, my English teacher knew the book, so it's still quite famous in the US.
