Zenn is one of the most popular online communities for Japanese software developers. It is a place where developers meet to share their knowledge and stories.

When Zenn was published a few years ago, you could post a typical article like you can on similar sites like dev.to as long as I can remember. Now the site has a feature: [Scraps](https://zenn.dev/zenn/articles/about-zenn-scraps).
