Zenn is one of the popular online communities of Japanese software developers. It is a place where developers meet to share their knowledge and stories.

When Zenn was published several years ago, you could post an typical article as you can do it in similar sites like dev.to as long as I remember. Now the site has a function: [Scraps](https://zenn.dev/zenn/articles/about-zenn-scraps).
